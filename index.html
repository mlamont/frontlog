    Try stuff. Out loud. With friends.

    
    <h2 style="font-family: serif">Help orgs love us Agilists.</h2>
    Problem:<BR>
    <ul>
      <li>:( we are dispensible<BR>(check your LinkedIn feed)</li>
      <li>... folks don't value what we do<BR>... (ours is a relatively newer role)</li>
      <li>... ... folks don't know what we do<BR>... ... (much beyond highly visible facilitation: tip of the iceberg)</li>
      <li>... ... ... we don't show what we do<BR>... ... ... (Agility takes on a variety of forms: bulk of the iceberg)</li>
    </ul>
    Solution:
    <ul>
      <li>... ... ... we do show what we do<BR>... ... ... (we model an empirical approach for complex work)</li>
      <li>... ... folks do know what we do<BR>... ... (folks learn an empirical approach for complex work)</li>
      <li>... folks do value what we do<BR>... (folks adopt an empirical approach for complex work)</li>
      <li>we are indispensible :)<BR>(fun and profit)</li>
    </ul>
    so yes: better market our Agility ("the output") (fear-based motivation)<BR>
    but also: better manage our Agility ("the effort") (love-based motivation)<BR>
    ...managing our Agility: tangible proof of a Cause/Belief:<BR>
    ... ..."Making decisions based on feedback from what we deliver is good for the org."<BR>
    ... ..."Conscious evolution is good for the species." (this is what I'd say to fellow Agilists)<BR>
    ...making our work visible refines how we do our work (another belief)
