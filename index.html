    Try stuff. Out loud. With friends.<BR>
    <BR>

    
    <h2 style="font-family: serif">Help orgs love us Agilists.</h2>
    Problem:
    <ul>
      <li>:( we are dispensible<BR>(check your LinkedIn feed)</li>
      <li>... folks don't value what we do<BR>... (ours is a relatively newer role)</li>
      <li>... ... folks don't know what we do<BR>... ... (much beyond highly visible facilitation: tip of the iceberg)</li>
      <li>... ... ... we don't show what we do<BR>... ... ... (Agility takes on a variety of forms: bulk of the iceberg)</li>
    </ul>
    Solution:
    <ul>
      <li>... ... ... we do show what we do<BR>... ... ... (we model an empirical approach for complex work)</li>
      <li>... ... folks do know what we do<BR>... ... (folks learn an empirical approach for complex work)</li>
      <li>... folks do value what we do<BR>... (folks adopt an empirical approach for complex work)</li>
      <li>we are indispensible :)<BR>(fun and profit)</li>
    </ul>
    so yes: better market our Agility ("the output") (fear-based motivation)<BR>
    but also: better manage our Agility ("the effort") (love-based motivation)<BR>
    ...managing our Agility: tangible proof of a Cause/Belief:<BR>
    ... ..."Making decisions based on feedback from what we deliver is good for the org."<BR>
    ... ..."Conscious evolution is good for the species." (this is what I'd say to fellow Agilists)<BR>
    ...making our work visible refines how we do our work (another belief)<BR>
    <BR>
    
    
    <h2 style="font-family: serif">Market what you do.</h2>
    A Frontlog is an ordered list... of process improvements ("Try stuff.")... managed by a Scrum Master.<BR>
    Frontlog.eth ("Out loud.") is a collection of Frontlogs... from teams across the world... managed by a Scrum Master Community. ("With friends.")<BR>
    <BR>

    
    <h2 style="font-family: serif">Manage what you do. Together.</h2>
    Primary utility: "the effort"... by the Scrum Master (or Agile Coach or dual-hat Scrum Master)
    <ul>
      <li>much like a Backlog helps with the craft of Product Ownership,<BR>
        a Frontlog helps with the craft of Scrum Mastery</li>
      <li>the level of effort is reflected in<BR>
        the level of quality of the Frontlog Items</li>
      <li>Frontlog Items... check out the examples!</li>
    </ul>
    Secondary utility: "the output"... for the Community (of Agilists)
    <ul>
      <li>much like inspecting Backlogs enables cross-org coordination & adaptation of product improvements<BR>
        inspecting Frontlogs enables cross-org coordination & adaptation of process improvements</li>
      <li>the breadth of high quality experiments through tactical documentation enhances<BR>
        the depth of purposeful connections inspiring further experimentation</li>
      <li>further experimentation... check out the examples!</li>
    </ul>
    Tertiary utility: "the chatbot"... from our plans of, and to inform, our Agility (AI for Agile)<BR>
    <BR>

    
    <h2 style="font-family: serif">Steal ideas. Like these.</h2>
    Frontlog Items:
    <ul>
      <li>Finish more stories in the first week of the Sprint.</li>
      <li>Pair program on items pointed 5 or more.</li>
      <li>Invite to the Daily Scrum a dev from a team on which we're dependent.</li>
    </ul>
    Further Experimentation:
    <ul>
      <li>A Team that's tried mob programming does Q&A for a team that's about to try.</li>
      <li>Coordinate activities of shared learning goals across some teams.</li>
      <li>Scrum Masters share techniques for common, upcoming Frontlog Items.</li>
    </ul><BR>
    <BR>
    

    <h2 style="font-family: serif">Try stuff. Out loud. With friends.</h2>
    We Agilists GET to help teams with their Hero's Journey.
    <ul>
      <li>("Try stuff.") We GET to co-create their story.</li>
      <li>("Out loud.") We GET to share their story.</li>
      <li>("With friends.") We GET to help others with theirs.</li>
    </ul>
    We Agilists CAN FINALLY manage Agility in an Agile way.
    <ul>
      <li>("Try stuff.") Think it deep. Share it here.</li>
      <li>("Out loud.") Help yourself kick butt at your job.</li>
      <li>("With friends.") Help your friends with their.</li>
    </ul>
    shamelessly urgent appeal, regarding your job: THIS may be TOO important NOT to try.<BR>

    extrinsic motivation ... high breadth:<BR>
    Managers tell their Agilists to use this.<BR><BR>

    intrinsic motivation ... high depth:<BR>
    Agilists invite other Agilists to use this.<BR><BR>

    inspired motivation ... high stickiness:<BR>
    Agilists lead fellow Agilists to use this.<BR>
    ...lead: try stuff out loud<BR>
    ... ...try stuff: explore & own<BR>
    ... ...out loud: share the adventure<BR>
    ...fellow: with friends<BR>
